# AI Platform Training

## Overview

TensorFlow's Estimator API parses the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable,
if present, and uses the relevant details from `TF_CONFIG` to construct properties
for distributed training, including the cluster spec, task ID, and other
properties.

If your application uses tf.estimator for distributed training, the propagation
of properties to the cluster spec works automatically, as AI Platform sets
`TF_CONFIG` for you.

Similarly, if you run your distributed training application on AI Platform with
a custom container, then AI Platform sets `TF_CONFIG` and populates an environment
variable, `CLUSTER_SPEC`, on each machine.

## Prerequisites

* Setup your project by following the instructions in the [setup](../../../../setup) folder.
  Run [variables.sh](../../../../setup/variables.sh) in [setup](../../../../setup) folder.
  
 ```bash
    source ./variables.sh
 ```
 
* Download the datasets using [download-taxi.sh](../../../../datasets/download-taxi.sh) in [datasets](../../../../datasets) 
folder.

 ```bash
    source ./download-taxi.sh /your_local_datasets_dir/
 ```
* Create a Python 3 virtual environment and activate it.
* Change the directory to this sample and run: 

  ```
  python setup.py install
  ```
  
  Optional: You can also run:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Run code in `tensorflow/structured/base/trainer/` location using the `config.yaml` in this folder.

**Note:** This is mostly for local testing of your code. When you submit a training job, no code will be executed on your local machine.
